### \[2025-05-20] ‚Äì Implemented File Management Core

**Change Type:** Added
**Description:** Created core file management functionality with three key modules:
1. pathUtils.js - Ensures safe Windows path handling

3. fileManager.js - Handles folder scanning and file organization

**Impacted Sections:** 
- Created `/src/scripts/utils/pathUtils.js`

[2025-05-21] ‚Äì Merged PRD Versions

Change Type: Removed
Description: Consolidated PRD.md into Electron App PRD.md to avoid duplication.
Impacted Sections: PRD.md, Electron App PRD.md
Next Steps: Delete or archive PRD.md, continue edits only in Electron App PRD.md.

### [2025-05-21] ‚Äì Recursive Folder Scanning
**Change Type:** Added
**Description:** Implemented IPC-based folder scanning to handle large drag-and-drop imports and gather absolute paths for .R3D, .MOV, and .MXF files.
**Impacted Sections:** main.js, preload.js, src/scripts/fileManager.js, PRD folder ingestion section.
**Next Steps:** Integrate scanned file groups into gallery display.

## 2025-05-21 ‚Äî Patch 02

- üõ† Fixed folder selection bug when using click-based picker (path undefined).
- ‚úÖ Verified drag-and-drop folder import already works as intended.
- üõ† Switched blocking error dialogs to non-blocking UI error flow.
- ‚öô Implemented backend hookup plan for "Start Export" button.

### [2025-05-21] ‚Äì Folder Picker + Export Button Integration

**Change Type:** Added  
**Description:**  
- Applied Codex patch_02 to implement manual folder selection using `dialog.showOpenDialog` with path validation before IPC call.  
- Applied patch_03 to begin wiring up export trigger from renderer via `ipcRenderer.send('start-export', options)`.

**Impacted Sections:**  
- Electron App PRD > Folder Ingestion (manual)  
- Electron App PRD > Export Screen  
- `main.js`, `renderer.js`, `fileManager.js`, UI export page

**Next Steps:**  
- Validate end-to-end export process using FFmpeg  
- Add error feedback and export progress indicator to UI

### [2025-05-21] ‚Äì Corrected Export Button "Pending API Update" Error
**Change Type:** Changed/Fixed
**Description:** Resolved an issue where the "Start Export" button would show a "Pending API update" alert. The root cause was `export.js` (containing the correct `MediaExporter` class using `electronAPI`) not being included in `index.html`, and a conflicting event listener for the same button ID existing in `renderer.js` which showed the alert.
**Impacted Sections:** 
- `src/index.html` (added script include for `export.js`)
- `src/scripts/renderer.js` (commented out conflicting event listener)
- `src/scripts/export.js` (now correctly loaded and handling the export button)
- Electron App PRD > Export Screen (updated problem/fix description)
**Next Steps:** Continue with validating the end-to-end export process, including dynamic path selection and progress feedback.

### [2025-05-21] ‚Äì Applied Patch for FFmpeg Input Path and Error Tracing
**Change Type:** Changed/Fixed
**Description:** Applied a user-provided patch to enhance FFmpeg export functionality.
- `src/scripts/export.js`: Rewritten to use a new `MediaExporter` class structure. It now collects all files from `window.groupedFiles`, prepares `exportOptions` (including multiple input files, format, and a temporary hardcoded output directory), and sends them via `window.electronAPI.exportMedia()`. An event listener is now directly attached to the export button.
- `main.js`: The IPC handler for exports was changed from `start-export` to `export-media`. The new handler iterates through each input file, spawns an FFmpeg process, and provides more detailed status objects (`{ status, file, originalFile, message }`) via `export-complete` for each file. It also creates the output directory if it doesn't exist.
- `preload.js`: Updated `electronAPI.exportMedia` to use the new `export-media` IPC channel. The `onExportComplete` handler was modified to pass the entire detailed status object to the renderer's callback.
**Impacted Sections:** 
- `src/scripts/export.js`
- `main.js`
- `preload.js`
- Electron App PRD > Export Functionality (updated problem/fix description and addendum)
**Next Steps:** 
- Test the patched export functionality thoroughly.
- Address potential discrepancies in the patched `export.js` (HTML element IDs: `start-export` vs `startExport`, `export-format` vs `exportFormat`; structure/source of `window.groupedFiles`).
- Implement dynamic output directory selection.
- Enhance UI to display batch progress and individual file export statuses using the new detailed information from `export-complete`.

### [2025-05-21] ‚Äì Resolved Runtime Errors in `main.js` and `export.js`
**Change Type:** Changed/Fixed
**Description:** 
- Fixed `SyntaxError: Identifier 'fs' has already been declared` in `main.js` by renaming the duplicate `fs` import (for synchronous operations) to `fsSync` and updating its usages. The `fs/promises` import remains as `fs`.
- Fixed `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')` in `src/scripts/export.js` by correcting the `getElementById` call for the export button from `start-export` to `startExport` to match the ID in `index.html`.
**Impacted Sections:** `main.js`, `src/scripts/export.js`.
**Next Steps:** Verify application stability and continue with export functionality testing.

### [2025-05-21] ‚Äì Applied Patch for Export File Handling and UI Feedback
**Change Type:** Changed/Fixed
**Description:** Applied a user-provided patch to improve export functionality:
- `renderer.js`: Ensured `window.groupedFiles` is populated from `window.cameraGroups` for use by `export.js`.
- `export.js`: Added a check to prevent export and alert the user if no files are selected/detected. Added minor robustness checks.
- `main.js`: Updated the `export-media` IPC handler to use `'./ffmpeg/ffmpeg.exe'` as the path, improved individual file existence checks before processing, and refined logging/reply messages. Retained `ffmpeg.on('error')` handler for robust error catching.
**Impacted Sections:** `src/scripts/renderer.js`, `src/scripts/export.js`, `main.js`, Electron App PRD > Export Functionality.
**Next Steps:** Thoroughly test the export process with various scenarios, including empty selections and missing files.

### [2025-05-21] ‚Äì Export Input Path Now Uses Full Absolute Path
**Change Type:** Fixed
**Description:** Ensured export uses correct `.fullPath` to prevent FFmpeg from failing with 'file not found'. Resolved RED/MXF subfolder issues during export.
**Impacted Sections:** fileManager.js, renderer.js, export.js
**Next Steps:** Add per-file success/failure feedback to gallery.

### [2025-05-21] ‚Äì Added Export Folder Picker
**Change Type:** Added
**Description:** Allows users to select output folder for transcoded exports via Electron dialog. Falls back to default if none selected.
**Impacted Sections:** export.js, preload.js, main.js, index.html, Electron App PRD (Export Screen)
**Next Steps:** Persist last-used folder, add UI validation if folder is not writable.

### [2025-05-21] ‚Äì Added Cancel Export Button
**Change Type:** Added
**Description:** Users can now cancel all in-progress FFmpeg transcodes via a ‚ÄúCancel Transcode‚Äù button. Useful for large batches or emergency stops.
**Impacted Sections:** export.js, main.js, preload.js, index.html
**Next Steps:** Add UI message on cancellation.
